      description:"Student Alumni Meet is the newly introduced flagship event. Planned to be inaugrated in the year 2021, SAM is going to be a massive conjuncture for the students and the alumni, bringing them together under the same roof. The grand event will be furnishing a series of mini-episodes like Mock Interview Prep, Cultural get-together, Sports get-together, Panel discussion, Guest lectures, etc. The central objective behind this initiative is to bring the student community closer to the alumni community, thereby establishing an enduring bond between the two. The intention and inspiration behind having this event comes from the idea of encouraging and motivating our students through listening to the success stories of our distinguished alumni from their own mouth.",
